## USB Cash Drawer PID/VID Information
The PID (Product ID) of our USB cash drawers can change based on the DIP switch settings. This feature is intentional in case users have multiple drawers and want them to be distinguishable by software.

The VID (Vendor ID) for Star Micronics USB cash drawers is 0519 (in HEX). The PID, however, can vary depending on the DIP switch settings on the back of the cash drawer, which control the USB ID.

## DIP Switch Settings for USB IDs
The following table outlines how the DIP switches should be configured to assign a specific USB ID. The default factory setting is USB ID 1011, with all switches set to 0 (OFF).

## USB Interface PIDs
The PID changes based on the DIP switch settings (USB ID). Hereâ€™s how the USB ID relates to the PID:

- USB ID 1011: Default PID
- USB IDs 1012 - 1018: Custom PIDs, assigned based on the DIP switch configurations.
  
This customization allows users to track multiple drawers and distinguish them within their software environment.
